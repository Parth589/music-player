## How to build this repo and try it in yor own machine

```bash
node -v && npm -v
```

if this command fails that means you need to install node.

for linux users, they can get node installed in their machine by just running this command

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```

after completing the installation, open terminal in the folder in which the repositery is cloned and run this command

npm start
```
